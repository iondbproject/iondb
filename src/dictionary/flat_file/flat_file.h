@brief		Initializes the flat file implementation and creates all necessary files.
@details	A check is done to see if this is actually an attempt to open a previously existing
			flat file instance. This (should) only happen when this is called from an open context
			instead of an initialize. The flat file supports a special mode called "sorted mode". This
			is an append only mode that assumes all keys come in monotonic non-decreasing order. In this
			mode, search operations are significantly faster, but the store does not support deletions while
			in sorted mode.
@param[in]	flat_file
				Given instance of a flat file struct to initialize. This must be allocated **heap** memory,
				as destruction will assume that it needs to be freed.
@param[in]	id
				The assigned ID of this dictionary instance.
@param[in]	key_type
				Key category to use for this instance.
@param[in]	key_size
				Key size, in bytes used for this instance.
@param[in]	value_size
				Value size, in bytes used for this instance.
@param[in]	dictionary_size
				Dictionary size is interpreted as how many records (key value pairs) are buffered. This should be given
				as somewhere between 1 (minimum) and the page size of the device you are working on.
@return		The status of initialization.
